# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this project was to take an existing Pandas script, update the data frame to ignore the data that could be incorrect (in this case it was assumed that 9th grade data from one of the schools had evidence of academic dishonesty) and re-run the analysis on rest of the data.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
